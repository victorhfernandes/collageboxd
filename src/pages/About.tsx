        <Anchor href="https://tapmusic.net/">Tapmusic</Anchor> i decided to make

        For some reason that I don't know (Iâ€™m working on it) when downloading
        the collage on small screens the ratings are stretched, there are two
        solutions for this:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Put your mobile browser in{" "}
            <Anchor href="https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-activate-desktop-mode-in-any-browser-on-android-ios/">
              Desktop Mode
            </Anchor>
            . This will fix everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don't want to do the first you can download the image without
            the ratings, selecting the Hide Rating option.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </InfoItems>
