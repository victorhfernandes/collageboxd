# Collageboxd

**Your Letterboxd collage generator**

I love watching movies and keeping track of it on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), inspired by projects like [Receiptify](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/) and [Tapmusic](https://tapmusic.net/) i decided to make this project that creates an image of what you have logged on Letterboxd in a month or in a year of your choice.
